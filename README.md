# ProgrammerCalculator
Programmers Calculator created for 'C++ Programming' Course in Second year of University.

This was created using Visual Studio 2017, this is simply a repository to hold the code online. The Calculator was made using C++ with Windows Forms and allows the functionality of switching between a fully functional programmers and standard calculator interface. The structure of the code follows an object orientated approach, this means it is a lot more clear which section does what - it also means that other people working on the project can understand how to functions faster.
