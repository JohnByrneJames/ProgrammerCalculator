# ProgrammerCalculator
Programmers Calculator created for 'C++ Programming' Course in Second year of University.

This was created using Visual Studio 2017, this is simply a repository to hold the code online. The Calculator was made using C++ with Windows Forms and allows the functionality of switching between a fully functional programmers and standard calculator interface. The structure of the code follows an object orientated approach, this means it is a lot more clear which section does what - it also means that other people working on the project can understand how to functions faster.

To view the code that goes into creating the User Interface and arranging how the code interacts with the user, please download the zip file here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r_-x_i9w2V-ChRRwY8FXINk_ISyeQ_cV
